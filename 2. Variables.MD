## Variables in Python, A Complete Beginner-to-Advanced Guide

A variable in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in memory(RAM) as your program executes. 

Think of RAM as a giant whiteboard your computer uses while it's doing things. 

When your Python program declares a variable like `x = 10`, the number/value `10` is placed somewhere in RAM, and the variable `x` becomes a **label** pointing to that location.

When we say **‚Äú`x` becomes a label,‚Äù** we mean that in Python, the variable name `x` is essentially just a _**reference**_ or _**tag**_ that points to an object stored somewhere in memory‚Äîtypically in RAM.

**Here‚Äôs a simple analogy:**

-   Imagine memory (RAM) is a huge collection of lockers.
-   When you write `x = 10`, Python goes, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an object: the number `10`. Let me store that somewhere safe.‚Äù
-   Then it creates a label, `x`, and sticks it on that locker door‚Äîso whenever you write `x`, Python knows to go to that locker and pull out the `10`.

This makes variables in Python more like **name tags** than storage boxes. The value lives in memory, and the variable is just one of possibly many names that refer to it.

Here‚Äôs what happens step-by-step when a variable is used:

1.  **The program loads into RAM** from storage (like a hard drive or SSD).
2.  **Python allocates space** in RAM to store variable values.
3.  **When variables are updated**, Python reassigns their labels to new values in RAM.
4.  **Once the program stops**, all those variables vanish‚ÄîRAM is temporary.

Python is a **dynamically typed language**, which means you don‚Äôt need to declare a variable‚Äôs type before using it‚Äîit‚Äôs inferred automatically based on the assigned value.

**Dynamically typed language?**

üîß Let us compare with C that is **Statically** **Typed** (Type of variable)

In **C**, the type of every variable must be explicitly declared before use. This means:
```c
int age = 25;
float temperature = 36.5;
char grade = 'A';
```
Here, `int`, `float`, and `char` tell the compiler what kind of data each variable will hold. If you try to assign a different type later, the compiler will throw an error. This is known as **static typing**‚Äîtypes are fixed at compile-time.

üêç **Python is Dynamically Typed**

In **Python**, you just write:

`age = 25` `temperature = 36.5` `grade = 'A'`

No `int`, `float`, or `char` declarations. 

Python figures out the data type when the code runs. 

That‚Äôs **dynamic typing**‚Äîtypes are assigned at runtime, based on the value you assign.

You can even change types on the fly:

```python
x = 100       # int
x = "hello"   # now it's a str
x = [1, 2, 3] # now a list
```

Python doesn‚Äôt mind, but C would panic!

| Feature            | C                        | Python                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Typing Style       | Static                    | Dynamic                      |
| Type Declaration   | Required (`int x = 5;`)   | Not needed (`x = 5`)         |
| Type Checking      | At compile-time           | At runtime                   |
| Type Flexibility   | Fixed                     | Can change on assignment     |

So, Python lets you write faster with fewer declarations, while C gives you more control and safety by enforcing types strictly.

In Python, you don‚Äôt need to declare the variable type. Python figures it out for you based on the value you assign.

```python
a = 1000    # a is an integer
name = "Ryan"   # name is a string
```
## üßæ Data Types in Python
| Value              | Variable | Data Type | Description                         |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1000               | a        | int       | Whole numbers                       |
| 12.75              | b        | float     | Decimal numbers                     |
| "Ryan"            | c        | str       | Sequence of characters (text)       |
| True, False        | d, e     | bool      | Boolean values                      |
| None               | f        | NoneType  | Represents absence of a value       |
| 2 + 3j             | g        | complex   | Complex number                      |
| [10, 20, 30]       | x        | list      | Ordered, changeable collection      |
| (100, 200, 300)    | y        | tuple     | Ordered, unchangeable collection    |
| {10, 20, 30}       | z        | set       | Unordered, unique elements          |
| {1:"Sun", 2:"Mon"} | d        | dict      | Key-value pairs                     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Type Checking

You can check the data type of a variable using `type()`:
```python
a = 1000
print(type(a))   # Output: <class 'int'>

x = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'list'>
```
## üß™ More Examples
```python
num = 5000
temp = 36.6
message = "Hello, World!"
is_valid = False
nothing = None
name_list = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
months = ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar")
marks = {85, 90, 92}
person = {"name": "ryan", "age": 28}
```

## üö® Variable Naming Rules

**Here are the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts for naming variables in Python:**

‚úÖ Valid Examples:
```python
name = "Raghu"
_age = 30
score1 = 98
total_marks = 500
```

‚ùå Invalid Examples:
```python
2score = 98       # Starts with digit
class = 10        # 'class' is a keyword
father name = "Raghav"  # Space not allowed
```
